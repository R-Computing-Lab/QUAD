# FAQ

## How do I download this material and keep up to date with any changes?

Please note that this is a work in progress, with new material being added every week. 

If you just want to read the lecture slides or HTML notebooks in your browser, then you should simply head over to the [course website](https://r-computing-lab.github.io/QPAWG/). Remember to check back in regularly to get any updates. Or, you can watch or star the repo to get notified automatically.



## I've spotted a mistake or would like to contribute

Please [open a new issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/). Better yet, please fork the repo and [submit an upstream pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/). I'm very grateful for any contributions, but may be slow to respond while this course is still be developed. Similarly, I am unlikely to help with software troubleshooting or conceptual difficulties for non-enrolled students. Others may feel free to jump in, though. Additionally, if you'd like to contribute, but don't have something specific in mind, feel free to check out the issues section for potential ideas.
