# Lab B: Smokers in Whickham {#lab06b}
## Simpson's paradox

```{r include=FALSE}
library(tufte)
library(knitr)
options(
  htmltools.dir.version = FALSE, # for blogdown
  show.signif.stars = FALSE,     # for regression output
  digits = 2
  )
knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = FALSE)
```

## Getting started

```{r fig.margin=TRUE, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
include_graphics("img/whickham.png")
```

A study of conducted in Whickham, England recorded participants' age, smoking status at baseline, and then 20 years later recorded their health outcome.

### Packages

In this lab, we will work with the `tidyverse` and `mosaicData` packages.

Because this is first time we're using the `mosaicData` package, you need to make sure to install it first by running `install.packages("mosaicData")` in the console.

```{r}
library(tidyverse) 
library(mosaicData) 
```

Note that these packages are also loaded in your R Markdown document.

## The data

The data is in the `mosaicData` package. You can load it with

```{r load-data}
data(Whickham)
```

Take a peek at the codebook with

```{r eval=FALSE}
?Whickham
```

## Exercises

1. What type of study do you think these data come from: observational 
   or experiment? Why?

2. How many observations are in this dataset? What does each observation 
   represent?

3. How many variables are in this dataset? What type of variable is each? 
   Display each variable using an appropriate visualization.

4. What would you expect the relationship between smoking status and health outcome to be?

5. Create a visualization depicting the relationship between smoking status and health outcome. Briefly describe the relationship, and evaluate whether this meets your expectations. Additionally, calculate the relevant conditional probabilities to help your narrative. Here is some code to get you started:

```{r}
Whickham %>%
  count(smoker, outcome)
```

6. Create a new variable called `age_cat` using the following scheme:

- `age <= 44 ~ "18-44"`
- `age > 44 & age <= 64 ~ "45-64"`
- `age > 64 ~ "65+"`

7. Re-create the visualization depicting the relationship between smoking status and health outcome, faceted by `age_cat`. What changed? What might explain this change? Extend the contingency table from earlier by 
breaking it down by age category and use it to help your narrative.

```{r}
Whickham %>%
  count(smoker, age_cat, outcome)
```
