Quantitative methodologists develop and study the research methods and statistical models that drive psychological and educational research. Researchers and programs in quantitative methods range from very technical (e.g., statisticians and psychometricians who primarily invent new statistical models or computational methods to estimate those models) to quite applied (e.g., extending existing statistical methods to answer new questions and tackle specific difficulties in real data) or more theoretical (e.g., studying the implications of how researchers use and interpret statistical models). Depending on what kind of methodologist you want to become, you may need more or less training in math and statistics, and more or less interest in a substantive research area (such as cognitive psychology). If you have enjoyed your statistics classes, if you care about improving how social science is practiced, if you love computer programming, one of these programs might be a good fit for you. This document summarizes some key information about a number of graduate programs in quantitative methods, including some programs in Psychology, Education, and Human Development. The universities represented in this document are by no means an exhaustive list of quantitative methods programs: they represent just a small sample of programs that exist. For a much broader list of universities that offer programs in quantitative methods, see this Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_schools_for_quantitative_psychology Here is a list of graduate programs in educational measurement: https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/NCME/c53581e4-9882-4137-987b-4475f6cb502a/UploadedImages/Documents/Grad_Programs_1219.pdf Another, smaller list is available here: https://smep.org/resources/about-quantitative-psychology Heres an article (written 15 years ago but still relevant) arguing that science needs more methodologists: https://www.apa.org/monitor/sep05/quantitative Website Maintainer "],["attribution.html", "Attribution Major Attributions Additional Attributions", " Attribution This class leans heavily on other peoples materials and ideas.

In the methodology specialization this entails the development and application of new methodological approaches. This work spans all levels of analysis from the biological (genetics, physiology) to the social context (schools, families, neighborhoods, and the workplace), across many timescales (cells to society, milliseconds to millennia, cradle to grave). These methods are often applied to understand development in childhood, adulthood and old age; for the study of individual and interpersonal processes like emotion and learning; and for the development and evaluation of prevention and intervention programs. Students interested in quantitative methodology may be particularly interested in the Methodology Research Specialization and dual-title PhD programs in HDFS and Social Data Analytics, Demography or Social and Behavior Neuroscience. Faculty and Research Interests There are six core faculty members in the Quantitative Developmental Systems Methodology Core: Sy-Miin Chow Peter Molenaar Zita Oravecz Timothy Brick Michael Hunter Zachary Fisher with broad expertise in methods for understanding human health and behavior at multiple levels and time-scales. Specific interests include intensive longitudinal data collection methods (e.g. ecological momentary assessments, smartphone sensors, wearable and digital health measures, geospatial data); associated analyses such as structural equation modeling, dynamical systems, Bayesian modeling and estimation, data mining and machine learning approaches, intervention optimization and real-time adaptive intervention, network analysis, and statistical programming; and applications of these methods to diverse areas, including lifespan development, affect, cognitive, physiology, behavioral genetics, neurological (e.g. fMRI, fNIRS) activity, family, and health processes. General Curriculum Although students will develop areas of specialization in their study, HDFS is a single department and grants a single degree. Thus, all students complete a common core of coursework in their first year, covering the broad substantive themes of the department: Individual Development, Family Studies, Prevention and Intervention, and Developmental Methodology. While some students will elect to specialize in methodology, all students are also expected to develop strong skills in research methods, a hallmark of our graduate training. All students complete a common four-course methodology sequence, which focuses on research design, measurement, and statistics, with a strong emphasis on statistical approaches for modeling development and change over time, and complete two additional methods-focused courses of their own choosing. In consultation with their advisors, students fulfill the remaining course credit requirements through the selection of electives individually tailored to their research interests. These courses include seminars offered in the department, as well as courses offered in other departments throughout Penn State such as Demography, Womens Studies, Statistics, Psychology, Sociology, Information Services and Systems, Computer Science, and Communication Arts and Sciences. Students may wish to consider additional specialization through a graduate minor, a concurrent degree (e.g. masters degree in statistics) or a dual-title Ph.D. Admissions Criteria The two most important requirements are (1) evidence of academic aptitude, including strong communication and quantitative skills; and (2) a good substantive fit between the applicants interests and those of our faculty. We are interested in admitting students whose interests cut across the activities or work of several faculty members. HDFS has a strong collaborative culture and although students will be placed with a primary faculty advisor, it is not uncommon for students to work closely with more than one faculty member during their graduate training, or to change primary advisors as their research interests evolve. GRE scores are no longer required as of the Fall 2022 admissions cycle. Applicants are required to submit: A scientific writing sample. Official transcripts. Curriculum Vitae or Resume (optional). Statement of Professional and Career Plans. DEI Statement Three letters of recommendation. When you are ready to apply visit the Grad School Admissions and Program Information Portal, which will guide you through the materials required by the University, as well as program-specific required documents. Admissions Timeline Applications to the PhD program are due by December 1st. Funding All students admitted to the graduate program in HDFS are provided funding for their graduate study. Funding could be in the form of a fellowship or an assistantship, but both include (a) the full cost of tuition, (b) a stipend for living expenses, and (c) a health insurance subsidy. Tuition costs are paid directly by the fellowship or assistantship and therefore the student does not have the responsibility of paying the tuition. Funding is guaranteed for a minimum of 4 years, with the expectation that funding can be provided for as long as needed to complete the program, presuming the student remains in good standing and is in residence in State College. Mentoring / Student Engagement Philosophy Advisor assignments are made based of a mutual interest on the part of the student and faculty member(s). Applicants are strongly encouraged to identify faculty members with whom they would be interested in working in their applications. Prospective advisors are consulted during the admissions process, and may reach out to applicants for telephone interviews. During the Admissions Weekend, prospective students will be given the opportunity to meet with the individual faculty members to discuss research and training opportunities.

We seek to develop a foundational knowledge for graduate students of all areas and to provide state-of-the-art training for graduate students seeking a PhD in this field. The graduate program provides a rigorous curriculum, opportunities for experience in teaching, and extensive training and experience in research. Faculty and Research Interests Broad research areas currently represented by faculty members of the area include the development and testing of new statistical procedures (e.g., in structural equation modeling, multilevel modeling, and complex regression modeling), the investigation of sampling properties of established statistics using computer simulation methods and analytical asymptotic derivations, mathematical models of personality structure and person perception, and applied assessment techniques. General Curriculum The Quantitative Methods program offers graduate study leading to both the MA and PhD degrees; we generally do not admit applicants who intend to complete only the MA degree. Prospective students who wish to obtain their PhD will first be accepted into the Masters program, and upon completing the Masters, will then be admitted to the PhD program. Admissions Criteria Prospective students are typically expected to have a four-year BA/BSc degree in psychology or a related field, and ideally students will also have some coursework in statistics, quantitative methods, and/or mathematics. Students will be evaluated based on their aptitude in conducting quantitatively oriented research, as demonstrated by their coursework, research statement, and research experience. The GRE is optional for 2022-2023 admissions. Admissions Timeline The online application is open from September 1 to December 1 of the year prior to a programs start date (e.g., online applications will be accepted from September 1 to December 1, 2021 for programs beginning in September 2022). Note there is only one intake (in September) per year and applications will not be accepted after the December 1 deadline. Mid-March Final admissions decisions sent to unsuccessful applicants. Funding The MA and PhD programs are both fully funded, and students will receive a minimum stipend of $23,000 CAD per year (the average funding rate for students is typically between $27,000 and $30,000) via a combination of teaching assistantships, research assistantships, and grant funding. Students who are Canadian permanent residents are expected to apply for tri-council (NSERC, SSHRC, or CIHR) grants, and international students are expected to apply for internal UBC grants. Mentoring / Student Engagement Philosophy Students will work closely with quantitative faculty members, being actively involved in research starting early on in the program. Though students most typically work one-on-one with a particular faculty mentor, our area is very open to collaboration, and students may be involved in projects with multiple faculty members and other graduate students simultaneously. Students are also given the flexibility and support to pursue research projects on their own, if desired. Where Past Graduate Students Are Now Recent graduates of the quantitative methods program have gone on to obtain tenured or tenure-track quantitative methods faculty positions at universities in the United States and Canada (e.g., UC-Davis, McGill, York) as well as careers as methodological consultants and project managers in industry.

The SRM curriculum emphasizes conceptualization of applied problems, design and conduct of research and evaluation, development and application of new methodological techniques, and analysis and interpretation of data in the context of educational theory and practice, and critical examination of research based claims. The division offers methodological concentrations in 1) educational statistics and educational measurement, 2) evaluation, and 3) qualitative methodology that aim to prepare students to: - Critically examine research and evaluation - Develop data collection designs and instruments - Conduct conceptual and statistical analyses appropriate to the field of education as well as other behavioral and social sciences The SRM Division works with the SRM Evaluation and Assessment Group, CRESST (National Center for Research on Evaluation, Standards, and Student Testing), and the University of California Educational Evaluation Center (UCEC). Faculty and Research Interests The SRM Division focuses on partnering methodological innovation with practical applications. The faculty specialize in either statistical inferential, or qualitative-interpretive methods of research, and a multiple- methods approach to address the complex dimensions of research in social science and education. As a faculty, we are interested in the multiple forms of inquiry about educational questions, the development of critically reflective/reflexive habits of mind about research, and the way to effectively represent that research in writing. General Curriculum The SRM division offers two degree programs: the M.A. and the Ph.D. SRM also offers a certificate program in Advanced Quantitative Methodology in Educational Research which is open to all UCLA graduate students. Admissions Criteria Admission to the SRM Division is granted on a competitive basis. Review of dossiers is holistic and takes into consideration the unique combination of strengths and background of each candidate, in relation to their specific areas of interest. However, typical qualifications of admitted Ph.D. Students include: - The currently specified requirements of the Graduate Division of UCLA. - GPA above 3.0 for all upper-division undergraduate and graduate courses. - GRE combined Verbal and Quantitative score in the 310-320 range, and higher. - A primary career interest in research and teaching in institutions of higher education, working in a research or policy institute, or in student affairs or institutional research or leadership. - Realistic knowledge of the field and profession, and appropriate interests and career objectives aligned to those of the faculty in the program. Admissions Timeline Deadline for applications: Dec 1st Admissions Decisions: February Open house for admitted students: March Funding SRM students are typically funded to be engaged in their program full-time on campus through part-time teaching or research assistantships that cover education fees and provide a monthly salary. Teaching assistantships for SRM courses are assigned each year by the SRM faculty. Individual faculty members are also a resource in finding appropriate research positions. Students are responsible for planning ahead of time for fellowships and research and teaching assistantships in order to avoid gaps in funding. Special fellowships are coordinated through the Office of Student Services, and involve a separate application process. Students wishing fellowship support must apply for it each year (with the exception of multi-year fellowships like Spencer or Cota-Robles). Cota-Robles fellowship recipients should be engaged in research with faculty for at least years 2 and 3 Mentoring / Student Engagement Philosophy Upon admission to the program, students are assigned a faculty advisor. This is determined by matching the research interests of each student with those of a faculty member. The advisor may serve as an academic counselor, information resource, or otherwise assist the students progress through the program. The primary responsibilities of the faculty advisor are to approve the students academic program, to advise students on particular courses of study, and, along with the student, to initiate any petitions for change in degree status or program. At any time, students may change advisors without reprisals. If a student wishes to change advisors, s/he should consult both faculty members before undertaking such action and then should inform the Division Head and the Office of Student Services (OSS) of the change. Students are expected to be proactive in scheduling to meet with their advisor at least twice per quarter.

Students concentrating in quantitative psychology will generally fit into one of two categories. The first of these consists of students possessing excellent mathematical backgrounds and strong theoretical interests in technical problems in measurement theory, statistics, and modeling. The second group of students typically has more applied interests. While the latter group of students have preparation in mathematics, these students are more oriented toward the use of psychometric and analytic techniques in substantive research. Some students find it compatible to give equal attention to both these major aspects of the program. Students in the quantitative program are strongly encouraged to collaborate with faculty in substantive areas of psychology in addition to their quantitative training. These areas include but are not limited to couples analysis, longitudinal and diary data, health outcomes, and the biological underpinnings of psychopathology. Faculty and Research Interests Quantitative psychology provides an opportunity for students to specialize in measurement, methodology and research design and analyses relevant to data in the social sciences. Psychology faculty currently includes Han Du, Craig Enders, Amanda Montoya, and Steven Reise. Key areas of interest among the faculty are structural equation modeling, item response theory, multilevel modeling, and the analysis of fMRI data. You can see each facultys page by following this link: https://www.psych.ucla.edu/faculty/quantitative General Curriculum Our program does not offer a masters only track, all students are admitted directly into the PhD program. However, students can receive an MA in Psychology after completion of required coursework and their first-year project (251 series). Required coursework for the PhD include the introductory statistics series (250ABC), first year research project series (251ABC), quantitative aspects of assessment (255A), introduction to multilevel modeling (256A), multivariate analysis with latent variables (M257), and special topics in psychological statistics (258). Students must also enroll in the Quantitative Psychology Seminar (249) for at least 6 quarters. Students must also complete 8 credits (2 quarters) of the Quantitative Psychology Practicum, which provides training and experience with statistical consulting. After completing required coursework but prior to proposing their dissertation research, students complete their comprehensive exam (typically 3rd year) which can take any of three forms designed to help students gain experience relevant to their career goals. Students can 1) Write responses to questions developed from a reading list, 2) develop materials for a graduate-level course in methodology, or 3) prepare a grant application. For more information see our graduate student handbook: https://ucla.app.box.com/s/27yt5n0xr6q1qtskht4z2nl5wlws93p5 Admissions Criteria A Bachelors degree (Bachelors or Arts or Bachelors of Sciences) or its equivalent from an accredited university worldwide is not required to apply to our program, but is required to enter our program. A Masters degree is not required to apply or enter our program. Applications are considered only for the Fall quarter. The department regards a broad undergraduate background in the behavioral, biological, physical, and social sciences as the best preparation for graduate study in psychology. It is desirable but not required to have majored in psychology. A course in college level math or statistics is required.In addition, very careful consideration is given to your Statement of Purpose, research experience and letters of recommendation. An outstanding record in any one of these areas, especially demonstrated achievement in research endeavors, may compensate for poorer performance in another. Research experiencegained as a laboratory assistant, through independent studies or prior graduate work, or by writing a senior or honors thesisis a valuable asset for all applicants to the Ph.D. program.The Department seeks a diverse student body. Cultural diversity and socioeconomic background are strongly considered when assessing candidates potential for graduate study. Applicants are encouraged to include information on their background, achievements, obstacles, and special contributions to the discipline on their application. For the Fal 2021 cohor, GRE scores will not be required or considered for admissions. For more on admissions criteria please see https://www.psych.ucla.edu/graduate/prospective- students/preparation Admissions Timeline We admit students on a yearly cycle, entering in Fall semester. Applications are due December 1st, 2021 for admission in Fall of 2022. Interviews will take place between January - March. Admissions decisions will be made prior to the April 15th national deadline. Admissions decisions may come on a rolling basis, so please wait to hear from the department about the decision. Funding All students entering our program are guaranteed financial support for at least five years with a stipend of $24,000/year + in-state tuition/fees/insurance. Most funding is in the form of graduate assistantships (appointments of at least 50% of full-time equivalent), which include teaching assistantships and research assistantships. First year students TA at 25% for one quarter during their first year, and otherwise have no other required assistantships to receive their funding. First year students also have out-of-state tuition covered by the department; however, they are expected to apply for residence after their first year in California. International students must draft a plan for covering international student tuition, typically involving a funding commitment from faculty within the department. We have a variety of internal fellowships to support students including the Cota-Robles (supporting URM students), Graduate Research Mentorship Fellowship, Graduate Summer Research Mentorship Fellowship. Additionally students at UCLA are very competitive for the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. UCLA also allows students on fellowship to TA on top of their fellowship to supplement their income. For more on funding available through UCLA please see https://grad.ucla.edu/funding. Mentoring / Student Engagement Philosophy Our program focuses on a mentorship and co-mentorship model, where students entering the program are assigned one or more faculty mentors. Graduate students complete a first-year project (251 series) which involves a supervisor and a reader (both department faculty), to encourage students developing strong relationships with multiple faculty. Students frequently work with their mentorship, other area faculty, other departmental faculty, and across campus to develop strong collaborative skillsets. In particular, many departmental faculty in search of statistical support may hire quantitative psychology students as Graduate Research Assistants to foster a collaborative relationship in a substantive area. Students are required to identify a committee of 3 - 4 faculty members for both their qualifying exams and dissertation proposal and defense. So we encourage students to collaborate with many faculty in order to identify strong committee members in preparation for these milestones. Where Past Graduate Students Are Now Graduates from our programs can be found in academic and industry settings. A few recent examples include:  Wes Bonifay, Assistant Professor, University of Missouri, College of Education, Class of 2015  Andrew Moskowicz, Analyst, Roku Inc (Previously at Hulu), Class of 2017  Brian Keller, Assistant Professor, University of Texas Austin, Department of Educational Psychology, Class of 2019.

The study of quantitative methods is central to all aspects of social and behavioral sciences: science, education, public interest, and practice. This essential role of quantitative methodology within psychology is reflected in the fact that Division 5 - Evaluation, Measurement, and Statistics - is one of the Charter Divisions of the APA. The QMMS program includes research and development in a number of broad areas: measurement, research design and statistical analysis, as well as mathematical and statistical modeling of psychological processes. Faculty in the QMMS program develop new methodologies and evaluate existing methodologies to examine their behavior under conditions that exist in psychological data (e.g., with small samples). This work supports the substantive research of all areas within social and behavioral sciences. Faculty and Research Interests Faculty in the QMMS program have strengths in a wide array of topics, including Bayesian statistics, experimental and quasi-experimental design, meta-analysis, propensity score analysis, psychometric theory, structural equation modeling, hierarchical linear modeling, item response theory, longitudinal statistical modeling, sample size planning, and statistics that are robust to violations of assumption. General Curriculum Students are admitted into the PhD program, and they have the option to earn a masters degree along the way. Admissions Criteria Admissions are based on a combination of material that is required in the application packet. Although all of this material is weighed and is important to admissions decisions, we place a strong emphasis on fit with the QMMS program (e.g., whether research interests align between the applicant and the faculty member). We encourage you to reach out to the faculty member of interest to start a dialogue early to identify overlapping research interests. The official application must include the following: Statement of purpose Personal statement (e.g., contributions and achievements) Transcripts, including GPA Three letters of recommendation TOEFL or IELTS Scores (international students only) *Note that GRE scores are not required this year, but they can be optionally reported by applicants. Admissions Timeline Applications are due December 1, 2021. Soon after this date, the QMMS faculty will hold informal meetings with our top candidates to learn more about their goals and assess fit with the program. Admissions decisions are made within a few weeks of the application deadline. Funding Students receive funding support for six years, with options for extensions if needed. Student funding is through research- or teaching-assistant opportunities. In addition, there are a variety of fellowships that students can apply for, and summer funding is provided for all students through the department. Mentoring / Student Engagement Philosophy We have a very hands-on approach to mentoring, and our goal is to train independent researchers in quantitative methodology. Students are continuously engaged in research starting from their first day in the program. Each QMMS faculty member has a close relationship with the students working in their lab. Students will meet with their primary advisor in a one-on-one meeting weekly, and faculty with multiple students also hold regular lab meetings. Students work on individualized projects under their primary advisor, gaining valuable experiences in a variety of research activities. The QMMS faculty are a very close group, and we often collaborate on research projects, which makes co-advising a viable option for students interested in gaining intensive training from multiple labs. Professional development is an important element of our training philosophy. Each student has an advisory committee consisting of at least three faculty members (including the primary advisor), who provide support and mentoring on a variety of topics. Aside from research- related support, the advisory committee regularly provides guidance on other important professional topics such as teaching development, how to be an effective public speaker, and how to successfully navigate the job market. Where Past Graduate Students Are Now Students receive training to obtain the job they desire, which may include going into either industry (e.g., psychometrician) or academia (e.g., research or teaching professor, or postdoctoral scholar). Our former students have taken a variety of positions upon graduation; some have gone into industry (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, College Board, American Institutes for Research) and others have gone into academia (e.g., Pennsylvania State University, University of Missouri, and University of California, Santa Barbara). Our goal is to offer personalized training that opens up many different paths beyond graduation.

Our rigorous graduate curriculum provides training to students who wish to become psychometricians, quantitative methodologists, and evaluation professionals in social, behavioral, or educational fields, as well as for those who wish to pursue academic careers as faculty, teaching coursework in quantitative research methods, measurement, or program evaluation. Faculty and Research Interests We currently have 5 full-time faculty teaching in our program. Faculty research interests span a wide range of topics in the areas of psychometrics, measurement, evaluation and applied statistics (including modeling). Example research interests of faculty include latent variable modeling, methods for reproducible science, instrument design, assessing and measuring school effectiveness, research on evaluation, measurement of implementation fidelity, accounting for multi-level structures in causal observational studies and generalizing the results of randomized controlled trials to target populations. Additional information is available here: https://rmme.education.uconn.edu/selected-current-research-projects-for-mea-faculty/ General Curriculum We offer on-campus Masters and Ph.D. programs. Students in the Ph.D. program may elect to receive a Masters degree on the way to the Ph.D. We have also had strong Master students transfer to the Ph.D. program in the past. Additionally, we have two fully-online programs: A 30 credit MA degree and a 12 credit certificate in program evaluation. Our curriculum includes courses in educational statistics, measurement, program evaluation, research design, psychometrics, and modeling. Admissions Criteria At the Ph.D. level, we look for evidence that the student will be successful in both the coursework and the sustained independent research required to complete a doctorate. Although academic and research indicators such as undergraduate coursework, grades, and research experience enter into the decision making process, one of the most important elements of the application packet is the personal statement, which provides information about the students research interests, potential fit with the program, and future academic and career goals. Admissions Timeline PhD applications are due December 1st for full funding consideration. Masters applications are accepted on a rolling basis until June 1. Funding The PhD program offers funding in the form of graduate assistantships to full-time PhD students. These are awarded on a competitive basis. Research and teaching assistantships fully cover the cost of tuition and also provide group health insurance. Typically, we are able to fund 3-4 incoming PhD students per year, and historically, such students are funded for the duration of their PhD program, as long as they maintain adequate academic progress and perform satisfactorily in their assigned assistantship duties. Occasionally, there is funding available for on-campus Masters students. The most competitive incoming students also compete for University fellowships and College level awards. Some students secure external funding from government or private agencies to support them as they pursue their degrees. Many of our students participate in paid summer internships at least once during the PhD program, and summer assistantships are often available to continue work on externally funded research projects over the summer break. Mentoring / Student Engagement Philosophy At the PhD level, students receive a great deal of individualized mentoring from their major advisor and program faculty. Generally, the first year or two of the PhD program is more course heavy, as students develop competencies across our six areas. During this time, students generally join research projects led by faculty. As students progress through the program, they take increasing ownership over research projects, under the guidance and mentorship of RMME faculty. They also develop an academic identity and an area of research specialization in a specific area within RMME. The dissertation represents the culmination of the students development as an independent researcher.

We work toward this goal by developing better models of behavior, cognition, and brain function through translational research and the creation of new computational and statistical tools that allow us to extract meaningful and useful conclusion from complex data. Faculty and Research Interests The Brain, Behavior, and Quantitative Science program has 7 affiliated faculty members in the department of Psychology. Program research interests include behavioral economics, cognitive neuroscience, cognitive science, developmental science, learning, and quantitative and computational methods. Faculty members recruiting students for the Fall 2022 year include Jeffrey Girard (interests in affective computing, machine learning, and Bayesian modeling), Tim Pleskac (interests in behavioral economics, computational models of human behavior and cognition), and Amber Watts (interests in health behaviors, prevention strategies, and bio-behavioral processes associated with cognitive decline &amp; dementia). General Curriculum We offer a single doctoral degree in Psychology; students admitted to this program enter with the expectation of continuing graduate study through the Ph.D. as the department does not admit terminal masters students. Although most applicants have majored in psychology as undergraduates, this is not required. The Ph.D. program in Brain, Behavior, and Quantitative Science provides instruction and research training for students pursuing careers in the academic, public, and private sectors that draw on the research and scholarly interests of the group. A key aspect of the program is that each students training plan is individually tailored and fit to each students personal goals. In general, though, a strong emphasis is placed on students developing a fundamental understanding of psychological theory, acquiring advanced statistical and computational skills and expertise, and learning how to apply this science to improve the development and/or wellbeing of individuals in society. Toward this end, the program requires both coursework and constant involvement in the research endeavor, whether in the laboratory or in the field, and (where appropriate) active engagement in opportunities to translate basic science into practice or application.

Quantitative students typically focus on methods development and/or evaluation, but can also apply these methods to a topic in a substantive area of psychology, such as cognitive, clinical, developmental, of behavior genetics. The extent of the substantive training above and beyond the quantitative training will depend on the interests of the individual student. The quantitative area faculty train students to have expertise in a variety of analytical tools and to advance methodology through novel research on statistical applications and creative use of existing techniques. Topics of expertise within the area include applied statistics, longitudinal analysis, Bayesian statistics, factor analysis and SEM, robust statistics, missing data, computational statistics, item response theory, mixture analysis, and statistical learning. As in all of our areas, there is great flexibility of curriculum, and students may work with a variety of faculty, both within and between programs. Faculty and Research Interests  Ying (Alison) Cheng, Professor. Dr. Ying Alison Chengs research focuses on psychological and educational measurement. In particular, she is interested in theoretical development and applications of item response theory (IRT), including computerized adaptive testing (CAT), test equity across different ethnicity/gender groups (formally known as different item functioning or DIF), classification accuracy and consistency with licensure/certification of state graduation exams. Recently she is working on cognitive diagnostic models and their applications to CAT. https://lambslab.nd.edu/  Ross Jacobucci, Assistant Professor.

We train students not only to become experts in the use of quantitative methods, but also to expand the field of methodology by developing and evaluating new statistical methods. The program is part of UW Madisons Educational Psychology Department, whose overall mission is to advance education-related theory and methodology; to improve knowledge about the biological, psychological, technological, and social processes of learning, development, and mental health in diverse populations; and to enhance learning and mental health in educational and community contexts through innovative educational interventions and effective prevention/intervention programs. Faculty and Research Interests Our program has five core faculty members. Current areas of interest among the faculty include measurement theory, item response theory, Bayesian inference, longitudinal data analysis, multilevel modeling, experimental and quasi-experimental design, causality, structural equation modeling, and research synthesis methods. You can learn more about us (and see pictures of us smiling awkwardly) here: https://edpsych.education.wisc.edu/academics/quantitative-methods/faculty/ General Curriculum Our program offers a non-terminal M.S. and a Ph.D degree. Students entering the doctoral program typically earn an M.S. en route to completing their Ph.D. Because we are a small program and follow a research-focused mentorship model, it is rare for us to admit students interested in obtaining a terminal Masters degree. Admissions Criteria Specific admissions requirements for the department may be found at: https://edpsych.education.wisc.edu/admissions/. The area evaluates all applications holistically, paying particular attention to the applicants foundational coursework and experiences in statistics, mathematics, and research methods, their articulated scholarly interests, and the alignment of those interests with the programs mission and the specific research programs of the faculty. Admissions Timeline We admit students on a yearly cycle, entering in Fall semester. Applications are due December 1st, 2021 for admission in Fall of 2022. Funding All students entering our program are guaranteed financial support for at least four years. Most funding is in the form of graduate assistantships (appointments of at least 50% of full - time equivalent), which include teaching assistantships, project assistantships, and research assistantships. Assistantships include a monthly stipend, tuition remission, and health insurance subsidy. More information about funding can be found at https://grad.wisc.edu/funding/ Mentoring / Student Engagement Philosophy Our program follows a mentorship model, in which students work extensively with faculty mentors from their first year in the program through their dissertation work. Throughout their studies, students are typically involved in and contributing to methodological and applied research, in collaboration with their mentors, other program area faculty, and often with researchers from a range of other fields. Where Past Graduate Students Are Now Graduates of our program may go on to careers  in academia (past graduates are currently on the faculty at Columbia University, University of Missouri, and University of California, Riverside, among others)  in the testing industry (including firms such as the Educational Testing Service, ACT Inc., and the College Board), and  at research firms (such as the American Institutes for Research). A list of our alumni can be found here: https://edpsych.education.wisc.edu/academics/quantitative-methods/graduates/ "],["wake-forest-university.html", "Wake Forest University General Psychology Masters Program Program Mission Faculty and Research Interests General Curriculum Admissions Criteria Admissions Timeline Funding Mentoring / Student Engagement Philosophy", " Wake Forest University General Psychology Masters Program https://psychology.wfu.edu/ Program Mission Our graduate program is a research-oriented general Masters program. As such, it provides broad training in psychology rather than training in a particular specialized area (e.g., clinical). Most of our students use our program to gain the preparation and qualifications to attend a high-quality doctoral program in their specific area of interest. Our program is a good choice for students who know they want to complete doctoral work, but are not sure what area they want to specialize in. Additionally, it is a good choice for students who have good qualifications, but want to improve their qualifications even more to make themselves better prepared for the doctoral programs of their choice. The general Masters program provides a strong basis for selecting a PhD program as well as a strong academic foundation for doctoral work. Most importantly, it provides considerable research experience  with a high degree of individual attention from graduate faculty. Your personal training would reflect a blend of your interests and the interests of the advisor who youre paired with. Please see the faculty web page for details on faculty research interests. The department has an excellent record of placing graduates in doctoral programs in all major areas of psychology. Faculty and Research Interests We have 4 core quant faculty  Veronica Cole, Mike Furr, Mason Garrison, and Eric Stone  with expertise in behavior genetics, data visualization, integrative data analysis, structural equation modeling, measurement non-invariance, psychological measurement, and other exciting things! General Curriculum We offer a terminal masters general psychology. All students take the following courses, although the timing of the courses changes depending on faculty availability. Below is the timing for our current graduate students. FIRST-YEAR FALL COURSES  Research Design and Analysis I  Seminar in Developmental Psychology  Seminar in Social Psychology SPRING COURSES  Research Design and Analysis II  Human Cognition  Seminar in Personality Research SECOND-YEAR FALL COURSES  Biological Psychology  Thesis Research SECOND-YEAR SPRING COURSES Current Topics in Psychology: (Alternates) Introduction to Psychometrics and R Data Science for Psychologists Admissions Criteria The Psychology Department enrolls 10 to 16 students each academic year. Admission is based on many factors, including but not limited to undergraduate GPA, GRE scores, research experience, letters of recommendation, and evidence of motivation. Although we do not have a strict cut-off for GRE scores or GPA, our past 3 year average GRE score is 315 (combined verbal and quantitative), and the average GPA is 3.76. We do accept students without a psychology major, particularly when they have the basic psychology training that is necessary for our program, such as Introductory Psychology, Research Methods, and Statistics. See the FAQ for more information on our admission procedure. Admissions Timeline  Jan 15: Application Deadline  Feb 1: We begin reviewing applications Funding Most of our students receive both assistantships (employment positions with stipends) and scholarships (that pay for tuition). The remaining students typically receive either full or partial scholarships. For those without stipends, we try to help you find jobs on campus or at the Med School campus. You do not need to submit anything additional in order to be considered for tuition waivers (i.e., scholarships) and assistantships (i.e., stipends). Wake Forests Graduate School awards scholarships based on merit. Tuition is set by Wake Forest University Graduate School, not the Psychology Department. Please see the Graduate Schools web page for the latest information, https://graduate.wfu.edu/cost-financial-aid-reynolda/ Mentoring / Student Engagement Philosophy The department adopts a mentorship model of graduate education in which students work closely with a faculty advisor during their two years in our program. Typically there is a 2:1 graduate student:faculty ratio that provides the student with individualized attention and, therefore, superior training. Because our program is designed to prepare students for entry into doctoral programs, there is a strong emphasis on research. Students conduct both a first- year research project and a thesis. These projects typically result in conference presentations and/or publications. We admit students into the program rather than to work with individual faculty members. Nonetheless, we do our best to match students with their preferred advisor whenever possible, and thus having a good match with one or two faculty members is an important part of the admission decision. Thus, we encourage you to highlight at least one or two professors who might be good matches to your interests. If your interests are still broad, thats fine, but provide us with some indication of the type of research you are interested in doing. Most faculty begin working with one new student each year; however, the faculty available to take new students in their lab varies from year to year for various reasons (e.g., sabbaticals, number of openings in a lab, etc.). You are welcome to contact a faculty member to see if she or he anticipates taking a student  please see the departments faculty web page for research interests and contact information.
