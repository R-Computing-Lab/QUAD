Quantitative methodologists develop and study the research methods and statistical models that drive psychological and educational research. Researchers and programs in quantitative methods range from very technical (e.g., statisticians and psychometricians who primarily invent new statistical models or computational methods to estimate those models) to quite applied (e.g., extending existing statistical methods to answer new questions and tackle specific difficulties in real data) or more theoretical (e.g., studying the implications of how researchers use and interpret statistical models). Depending on what kind of methodologist you want to become, you may need more or less training in math and statistics, and more or less interest in a substantive research area (such as cognitive psychology). If you have enjoyed your statistics classes, if you care about improving how social science is practiced, if you love computer programming, one of these programs might be a good fit for you. This document summarizes some key information about a number of graduate programs in quantitative methods, including some programs in Psychology, Education, and Human Development. The universities represented in this document are by no means an exhaustive list of quantitative methods programs: they represent just a small sample of programs that exist. For a much broader list of universities that offer programs in quantitative methods, see this Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_schools_for_quantitative_psychology Here is a list of graduate programs in educational measurement: https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/NCME/c53581e4-9882-4137-987b-4475f6cb502a/UploadedImages/Documents/Grad_Programs_1219.pdf Another, smaller list is available here: https://smep.org/resources/about-quantitative-psychology Heres an article (written 15 years ago but still relevant) arguing that science needs more methodologists: https://www.apa.org/monitor/sep05/quantitative Stuff Can Go in Footnotes  Stuff Can Go in Footnotes here also  "],["attribution.html", "Attribution Major Attributions Additional Attributions", " Attribution This class leans heavily on other peoples materials and ideas.

The Ph.D. in Educational Policy Studies allows students to examine the philosophy and practice of education and to develop skills in both the methodology and the study of educational practice. Students will prepare to become policymakers and examiners of policy and the effects of policy on education. Students can complete a concentration in Research, Measurement and Statistics as preparation to investigate research methodologies, to conduct research related to schools, and to conduct and critique research in educational practice, policy and administration. Students develop knowledge and skills in qualitative and quantitative research and evaluation methods. Faculty and Research Interests Faculty interests include research on teacher effectiveness and persistence, the effects of peers on student outcomes and program evaluation, applied measurement and quantitative methods in education, research in multilevel modeling and computerized adaptive testing, and methods for systematic review and meta-analysis. General Curriculum The degree programs in Research, Measurement, and Statistics include an M.S. in educational research; an online M.S. in educational research; and a Ph.D. in educational policy studies. Students who decide to pursue a Ph.D. in educational policy must have a masters degree. Admissions Criteria The admissions criteria for the M.S. in educational research program are the following: Complete online application Application fee of $50 Statement of purpose to upload with the application Resume (upload with the application) Two letters of recommendation Official transcript: minimum 2.5 undergraduate GPA required for admission. Must submit transcripts from all colleges and universities attended. Due to the onset of the pandemic, GRE scores are currently not required for the masters program. The admissions criteria for the Ph.D. program in educational policy studies are the following: Complete online application Application fee of $50 Statement of purpose to upload with the application Resume (upload with the application) Two Letters of Recommendation (recent letters from persons who can evaluate academic promise such as professors) Must have completed a masters level degree Official transcript: minimum 3.30 graduate GPA required for admission. Must submit transcripts from all colleges and universities attended. *Due to the onset of the pandemic, GRE scores are currently not required for the doctoral program. Admissions Timeline The application deadlines for the M.S. in educational research program (and the online version) are March 1st, October 15th, and March 1st for Fall, Spring, and Summer respectively. The application deadlines for the Ph.D. in educational policy studies program are January 15th for Fall. The doctoral program does not admit in Spring nor Summer. Funding Many of our faculty work on grant-funded projects that hire our students as graduate research assistants. For incoming doctoral students, there is the opportunity to apply for the Deans Research Doctoral Fellowship. For international and out-of-state students, tuition waivers are available to reduce the cost of tuition to the in-state rate. Mentoring / Student Engagement Philosophy Every incoming graduate student is assigned a faculty adviser upon entry into the program. Students are able to change their assigned advisor at any point in time, such as when a dissertation topic has been decided, if they see that another faculty advisor would be a better fit for that topic. The department also hosts student mixers each semester as a way to promote engagement and collaboration. Where Past Graduate Students Are Now The past graduates in the program have the following careers: Educational researcher Utilize quantitative and qualitative methods to formatively and summatively evaluate science education programs throughout the U.S. Code qualitative data from Federal Register Rule submissions.
