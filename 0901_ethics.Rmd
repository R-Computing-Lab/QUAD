# Welcome to Data and Ethics

This module is a bit different than the typical module. We'll be introducing ideas related to privacy and ethics in the context of data science. There is only one video this week. This week is dedicated to your mid-semester check-in with Mason. I encourage you to watch the video and work your way through the notes. You can find the video playlist for this module [here][ds4p-pl-09]. Most of the slides used to make the videos in this module can be found in the [slides repo][ds4p-slides].

## Annotated Bibliography Instructions

An annotated bibliography is a list of citations but with commentary! Ok, more like just an enhanced list where you summarize the source and explain why it is important to include.

Your mission is to add either a citation or an annotation (or both) to this list of Data Science and Ethics Readings.
